# CODEX-CODING-SPEC — Changelog

Single changelog for the pair `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (core) + `~/.codex/AGENTS-extended.md` (extended). From v1.4.0 both files carry ONE shared version and move together. This file sits outside the Codex discovery chain and costs zero context; the agent never loads it unless explicitly asked.

## v2.15.3 (2026-07-06) — uninstall/runtime + analyze argv bugfixes (no rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with a package bugfix — `uninstall` now leaves unregistered no-op hook shims so current Codex sessions with cached hook commands do not fail with bash exit 127, `doctor` treats shim-only state as uninstalled, `agentsmd analyze` rejects misleading argv combinations instead of silently running gather, and `secrets-scan` now handles private-key regexes that begin with `-`. No new hooks (count stays 15), no `live_sections`/manifest change. `spec_version` → v2.15.3. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.15.2 (2026-07-06) — parser & tooling robustness bugfix (no rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with a package bugfix from a second code review — the `agentsmd design` token parser is now string / comment / paren aware (a `;` inside `url(…)` or quotes no longer truncates a value; a `:root{` inside a string value is no longer read as a block), the `lint-argv` gate catches `findIndex`/`filter`, and two Minor correctness notes (version-cascade token boundary, perf-baseline even-N median) are fixed. No new hooks (count stays 15), no `live_sections`/manifest change. `spec_version` → v2.15.2. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.15.1 (2026-07-06) — design-token parser bugfix (no rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with a package bugfix — `agentsmd design`'s token parser now strips CSS comments before matching blocks (a `}`, or a commented-out `:root{}`, inside a comment no longer drops or forges tokens) and discloses a truncated scan in the no-tokens note. Surfaced by a code review of the v2.15.0 D1 release. A package bugfix, not a spec-rule change. No new hooks (count stays 15), no `live_sections`/manifest change. `spec_version` → v2.15.1. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.15.0 (2026-07-06) — design-adopt capability (no rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with a package feature — `agentsmd design` extracts a frontend project's design tokens (CSS `:root` custom properties + Tailwind v4 `@theme`) into a facts-only, sentinel-managed `DESIGN.md` + an `AGENTS.md` pointer. Deterministic, command-only, consent-gated (preview unless `--write`), stateless. Realizes the long-deferred `detect.js:6` "Phase 2" module. A package/tooling feature, not a spec-rule change. No new hooks (count stays 15), no `live_sections`/manifest change. `spec_version` → v2.15.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.14.0 (2026-07-06) — dev-ergonomics tooling batch (no rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with a package dev-ergonomics batch (Workstream E) — measured hook-latency (`perf-baseline`), a free-text version-drift gate (`version-cascade`), a hook single-source-of-truth registry backing `status`/`doctor`, a review-cadence `staleReviews` signal in `rules.js`, and an argv-antipattern gate (`lint-argv`) + a shared `argv.js` parser. No new hooks (count stays 15), no `live_sections` change, no manifest rule added. `spec_version` → v2.14.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.13.0 (2026-07-06) — two §-rules move from self-enforced to hook-observed; §9 parallel-path enters the manifest (no rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with a package enforcement/coverage batch. Two pre-existing self-enforced disciplines gain a Stop observer in `transcript-structure-scan` and move to hook-observed in `hard-rules.json` `live_sections`: **§6 Iron Law #2** (an evidence-fingerprint check on completed-fix claims — `§6-iron-law-2`) and **§10 Honesty** (an uncertain-section hedge check — `§10-honesty`); both carry `demote_policy: deterrence` (0 hits = the violation never arose, not dilution — a foundational rule stays core regardless of hit count). Separately, the **§9 parallel-path completeness** rule — already live prose in core §9 — becomes a first-class governed manifest entry (`§9-parallel-path`, self-enforced). No core or extended rule text changed. `spec_version` → v2.13.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.12.0 (2026-07-06) — first rule-text addition since v1.4.0: extended §E8 turn-yield; two §7 disciplines wired to Stop hooks

Unlike v2.6–v2.11 (all "no rule-text changes"), this release adds an **extended** rule: **§E8 MID-SPINE TURN-YIELD** — the per-turn analog of core §7 Session-exit (a silent mid-cycle turn-yield + next-turn "done" claim = Iron Law #2 evasion; `<system-reminder>`/hook injections are not turn boundaries). It lives in extended, not core (the ~32 KiB discovery-chain budget; the always-on protection is already core Iron Law #2 + §7 session-exit). Core rule text is unchanged. Separately, two pre-existing §7 disciplines move from self-enforced to hook-observed: `§7-session-exit` (session-exit-checkpoint hook) and `§7-memory-hygiene` (mem-audit hook), both added to `hard-rules.json` `live_sections`. `spec_version` → v2.12.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.11.0 (2026-07-05) — quieter convention citations + facts-only frontend section (no rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with two package refinements to what the plugin writes into a project's `AGENTS.md`: the convention-adoption citation instruction now directs a trailing `<!-- adopted-conventions: … -->` HTML comment instead of inline prose (the signal stops intruding on the user's answer; the `convention-cite-scan` hook is untouched), and `agentsmd init`'s `## Frontend` section is trimmed to the detected stack line (the generic per-stack guideline bullets, model-known boilerplate, are dropped). `OPERATOR.md` §O8 adds the convention-adoption review cadence. `spec_version` → v2.11.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.10.0 (2026-07-05) — secret-scan enforcement + governance exposure model (no core rule-text changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with a package enforcement/governance batch. The pre-existing §8 rule "plaintext secrets in code/logs/commits" goes from self-enforced to hook-enforced (a new `secrets-scan` PreToolUse hook — `§8-secrets` added to `hard-rules.json` `live_sections`), and the promote/demote governance gains an exposure/deterrence model (`demote_policy` field on the immutable §8 rules; `MIN_EXPOSURE_SESSIONS` gate in `rules.js`). `OPERATOR.md` documents the Codex-only measurement boundary and the `@conv-*` citation-vs-adherence caveat. The `spec/AGENTS-extended.md` header, which had silently lagged since v2.4.0, is re-synced — the drift test now asserts both core and extended headers. `spec_version` → v2.10.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.9.0 (2026-07-05) — project-convention adoption telemetry (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.9.0 in lockstep with a package feature — `agentsmd analyze` gains stable `@conv-<dim>` convention anchors, a `convention-cite-scan` Stop hook recording per-project adoption (`cite`) telemetry, and an `analyze --adoption` prune-candidate report. Advisory and independent of the global `§*` enforcement loop; a package/tooling feature, not a spec-rule change. `spec_version` → v2.9.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.8.0 (2026-07-05) — frontend-aware project AGENTS.md (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.8.0 in lockstep with a package feature — `agentsmd init` gains deterministic frontend stack detection and emits a `## Frontend` section (with a `--no-frontend` opt-out). A package/tooling feature, not a spec-rule change. `spec_version` → v2.8.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.7.1 (2026-07-04) — cleanup + gitignore ext-globs (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.7.1 in lockstep with a maintenance batch — `analyze --gather` honors `*.ext` gitignore globs, plus internal reporter cleanup and added tests. A package/tooling change, not a spec-rule change. `spec_version` → v2.7.1. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.7.0 (2026-07-04) — rules --project per-project activity (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.7.0 in lockstep with a read-side reporter enrichment — `rules --project` gains a per-rule `local:<n>` activity annotation (verdicts stay cross-project). A package/tooling feature, not a spec-rule change. `spec_version` → v2.7.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.6.0 (2026-07-04) — project-aware telemetry (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.6.0 in lockstep with a
read-side telemetry feature — `audit`/`rules` gain a `--project` filter and a
per-project breakdown, slicing the existing hit-log by the `project` field it
already records. A package/tooling feature, not a spec-rule change.
`spec_version` → v2.6.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.5.0 (2026-07-04) — project convention distiller (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.5.0 in lockstep with a
new `agentsmd analyze` command (+ `agentsmd-analyze` skill) that distills a
project's implicit conventions into its AGENTS.md, plus `init --local` — a
package/skill feature, not a spec-rule change. `spec_version` → v2.5.0. Detail:
repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.4.0 (2026-07-04) — project AGENTS.md generator (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.4.0 in lockstep with a
new `agentsmd init` command (+ `agentsmd-init` skill) that generates a
project-level `AGENTS.md` from deterministic stack detection — a package/skill
feature, not a spec-rule change. `spec_version` → v2.4.0. Detail: repo
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.3.0 (2026-07-04) — superpowers accelerator (spec-text change)

Core §4 gains a **Superpowers accelerator**: when the optional `superpowers`
plugin is present, matching task-types route to its skills (`brainstorming`,
`systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`)
as the concrete procedure for principles §3/§6 already mandate; absent → the §4
missing-skill rule applies, zero impact. Extended gains §E7 SUPERPOWERS
(`multi_agent` setup + wider skill set + boundary). Both headers move to v2.3.0 —
the extended header was stale at v2.1.2 and is now realigned with the shared
version. `spec_version` → v2.3.0. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.2.2 (2026-07-04) — review follow-ups (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.2.2 in lockstep with
post-review follow-ups (`bin/agentsmd.js` POSIX signal exit code, README `--ref`
bump, packaging E2E test, `ARCHITECTURE.md` bin/ note). `spec_version` → v2.2.2.
Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.2.1 (2026-07-03) — docs: npm install guidance (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged; the shared version moves to v2.2.1 in lockstep with a
docs-only fix — README now leads with `npm install -g @sdsrs/agentsmd` because
the bare `npx @sdsrs/agentsmd <cmd>` form is unreliable on npm 11.x. No package
code changed. `spec_version` → v2.2.1. Detail: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.2.0 (2026-07-03) — npm CLI (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged. The shared version moves to v2.2.0 in lockstep with a
new `agentsmd` npm CLI (`npx @sdsrs/agentsmd install`, replacing the old `npm
explore … -- node scripts/install.js` flow). `spec_version` → v2.2.0.
Hook/script/docs changes: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.1.2 (2026-07-03) — QA hardening (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged. The shared version moves to v2.1.2 in lockstep with
hook, installer, telemetry, config parser, and CLI hardening. `spec_version` →
v2.1.2. Hook/script/docs fixes: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.1.1 (2026-07-03) — npm scoped package publish (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged. The shared version moves to v2.1.1 in lockstep with
the npm package rename from unscoped `agentsmd` to scoped `@sdsrs/agentsmd`; npm
rejected the unscoped name as too similar to `agents-md`. Codex plugin identity
and installed runtime names remain `agentsmd`. `spec_version` → v2.1.1. Hook/script/docs
fixes: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.1.0 (2026-07-03) — distribution install surfaces (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged. The shared version moves to v2.1.0 in lockstep with the
agentsmd plugin's new distribution surfaces: root `install.sh`, repo marketplace
metadata for `codex plugin add agentsmd --marketplace agentsmd`, and README install,
update, and uninstall instructions. `spec_version` → v2.1.0. Hook/script/docs fixes:
repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.0.2 (2026-07-03) — install/update hardening (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text unchanged. The shared version moves to v2.0.2 in lockstep with management
layer fixes: stricter `doctor` health checks, exact install-dir hook markers, stale hook
cleanup on update, commented `[features]` table handling, and shell-special `CODEX_HOME`
support. `spec_version` → v2.0.2. Hook/script/docs fixes: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v2.0.1 (2026-07-03) — audit fixes (no rule-text changes)

Spec rule text is unchanged. Two spec-file edits are wording/accuracy only: the §7 task-file
example version was neutralized (`v1.4.3` → `<version>`, a stale literal that drifted every
release) and the Discovery byte-budget note corrected (`~2/3` → `~3/4`; core is ~74% of the
32 KiB cap). `hard-rules.json` reclassifies `§E3-ship-checklist` from `both` + an orphan
`rule_hits_section` (`§7-ship-baseline`, which no hook emits) to `self` — the 8-item gate is
agent-walked; only its item-2 green+fresh gate is hook-enforced, and that is the sibling
`§E3-ship-baseline` rule. `spec_version` → v2.0.1. Hook/script fixes: repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

Sizing: core 24,118 → 24,121 B (+3; the version placeholder + `~3/4` phrase; 73.6% of the
32,768 B cap, unchanged). Extended zero-budget (load-triggered).

## v2.0.0 (2026-07-03) — project rename (no rule changes)

Rule text unchanged. The shared version moves to v2.0.0 in lockstep with the plugin's
rename from **codexmd** to **agentsmd** — the tool's identity only; the `CODEX-CODING-SPEC`
title and every rule are the same. `hard-rules.json` `added_version` fields stay at v1.4.0
(when each rule was added). See the repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v1.4.3 (2026-07-03) — version-sync (no rule changes)

Rule text unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with the agentsmd plugin's
v1.4.3 fix (SessionStart `resume` no longer clears the advisory queue) + the empirical
confirmation that Stop advisories reach the model. See the repo `CHANGELOG.md`.

## v1.4.2 (2026-07-03) — version-sync (no rule changes)

Rule text unchanged; the shared version moves in lockstep with the agentsmd plugin's
v1.4.2 fix for the Codex 0.142 hook-flag rename (`[features].codex_hooks` → `hooks`).
See the repo `CHANGELOG.md`. `hard-rules.json` `added_version` fields stay at v1.4.0.

## v1.4.1 (2026-07-03) — version-sync (no rule changes)

Core + extended rule text is unchanged from v1.4.0; the shared version moves to
keep it in lockstep with the agentsmd plugin's v1.4.1 hook-delivery fix (Stop
advisories deferred to the next UserPromptSubmit — see the repo `CHANGELOG.md`).
`hard-rules.json` `added_version` fields stay at v1.4.0 (that is when each rule
was added).

## v1.4.0 (2026-07-02) — structural-hole + consistency release (audit-driven)

Structural fixes (rules previously voided by their own loading structure or timing):

- core §3 **Recurrence check**: L1 bugfixes now run `git log --grep` on the error signature before fixing; ≥2 prior fixes (3rd+ occurrence) → open L2 root-cause task. Closes the chicken-and-egg where §E5's cross-task detector lived in a file whose load trigger the detector itself defined, while §7 auto-write skip #3 discarded the data it needed. Git history is the signature store — no memory writes added.
- core §7 **Exit archival (HARD)**: `[BLOCKED]` / paused / three-strike exits must distill dead-ends + durable findings into `memory/` + one `MEMORY.md` index line before exiting (FS read-only → final message). Previously archival only happened at REPORT stage, which abnormal exits never reach — dead-ends could never be found by §4's `MEMORY.md` routing in later sessions.
- §E5 **Dead-end record** gains a leading `signature` field (verbatim error + `file:line`) — the grep anchor the recurrence check matches against.
- core header + §5 **Ship-family single source**: ship intent defined once in the core **Extended** line (`push` shared / merge / PR / publish / release / deploy); §5 hard's push/merge/publish/release entry now points to §E3 before execution. Extended header no longer duplicates the trigger list (dual-write drift removed; its old "(from core §2/§5)" attribution was inaccurate).
- §E1 **EMERGENCY** clarified: mitigation-first = ORDERING (rollback proposal + its AUTH precede root-cause work), never an AUTH waiver. **Mode conflict → most restrictive wins**; AUTONOMOUS × EMERGENCY defined — mitigation recommendation goes into `--output-last-message`, the action stays `[BLOCKED]` unless pre-authorized.
- core §7 **Spec anchor in task files**: L3 task files open with `spec: core+extended v1.4.0 loaded`; the existing resume re-read of the task file now mechanically re-triggers the extended load (replaces reliance on "suspected compaction" self-awareness).
- core §6 **Characterization-as-baseline** promoted from §E4 into Iron Law #1's refactor branch, so L2 refactors in test-less repos have a path besides `[PARTIAL]`. Closes the former "pending v1.4 / F3" item; the dangling F3 reference is removed. §E4 keeps only the L3 procedure detail.
- core §6 **Iron Laws intro** now names the sole sanctioned exception (EMERGENCY deferral of #1/#3, #2 never deferrable) — previously "all overrides" contradicted §E1's deferral on a literal core-wins reading, and §E1's "Iron Law #2 + §8 still bind" implied #1/#3 were off in modes.

Consistency fixes:

- **Unified versioning + external changelog**: core previously shipped without a changelog section while extended pointed at it ("see core changelog" — dangling). Both files now reference this file; §E6's "(demoted from core §4 in v1.3.2)" is resolvable below.
- core §8: `.git/info/exclude` exempted from the "edit `.git/` internals" Never (config surface, not object surgery); core §9 + §E1: adding the `tmp/` ignore line is a permitted L0 pre-step **including under HACK** — resolves the deadlock where HACK forbade tracked-source edits but guaranteeing `tmp/` ignored required one.
- core §9: git status of memory layers made explicit — `tasks/` gitignored (machine-local; insights must reach `memory/` via exit archival to count), `memory/` + `MEMORY.md` committed (the auditable layer §7 is built on).
- core §7: `MEMORY.md` eviction policy — stale + un-re-verifiable after one refresh attempt → line moves to `memory/archive_index.md`; prune least-matched lines when the index bloats.
- core header: build-specific skill-path claims ("`~/.codex/skills/` also scanned in current builds — confirm via `/skills`") moved out of the spec; stable rule instead — `/skills` is the live-set source, build-specific paths belong in `memory/reference_*.md`. Silent-truncation warning + cap-raise guidance added to Discovery.
- §E3 item 8: unattended/scheduled release declared out of scope **by design** (previously impossible-by-construction via §E3.8 × §E1-AUTONOMOUS, but unstated).

Sizing: core 21,983 → 24,118 B (73.6% of the default 32,768 B combined cap; ~8.6 KB left for project chains — raise `project_doc_max_bytes` to 65536 in `config.toml` if a project layer starves). Extended 6,160 → 7,166 B (zero-budget, load-triggered). Growth is the cost of moving structural rules into the always-loaded layer; deep compression deferred to a usage-data-driven pass.

## Pre-v1.4.0 (partial — reconstructed)

- v1.3.3 core / v1.3.1 extended: the audited versions. Core's own changelog had been trimmed for byte budget; its history is not preserved. Known entries only:
- v1.3.2 core: skill authoring demoted from core §4 to extended §E6.
- v1.3.1 extended (2026-07-02): initial skeleton — E1 override modes, E2 L3 flow, E3 ship checklist, E4 L3 evidence + cold-start, E5 three-strike detail, E6 skill authoring. Content was pre-deployment scaffolding.
